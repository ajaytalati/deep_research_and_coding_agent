# prompts_v7.yaml
# v7.0: Implements the "Read-Think-Write" logic for the Coding Agent.

# --- High-Level Task Definitions ---
research_generation_task: >
  # This task is now focused on the next evolution after the Coding Agent.
  **Primary Goal:** Produce a formal technical research report proposing an architecture for a **Master Project Manager (PM) Agent**.

  **Methodology:**
  1.  **Analyze Existing System:** Synthesize the current V5 architecture, which includes a complete Research -> Design -> Coding agent pipeline, communicating via structured JSON artifacts.
  2.  **Research Autonomous Agents:** Based on the knowledge base, research the concepts of executive function, meta-cognition, and autonomous goal-setting in agentic systems.
  3.  **Propose PM Agent Architecture:** Propose a high-level architecture for a Master PM Agent that can:
      - Observe the outputs of the full pipeline (reports, specs, code, test results).
      - Reason about the project's state.
      - Autonomously generate the next `research_generation_task` to continue the development loop without human intervention.

  Analyze the user's high-level request and the provided context. Your task is to create a structured **table of contents** for the requested artifact, formatted as a JSON object.
  **Instruction:** The plan you create should be a skeleton or outline for the **final document itself**, NOT a list of your internal process steps.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the schema below. Do not include any other text, comments, or markdown formatting.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "title": "<A concise title for the proposed artifact>",
    "plan_items": [
      {{"section_id": "<e.g., 1.0>", "title": "<Title of the first section>", "description": "<A one-sentence description of what this section will cover.>"}}
    ]

  You are a metadata and systems analysis expert. Your task is to read the following final research report and distill its core conceptual and architectural information into a structured JSON object.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the schema below. Do not add any other text or markdown.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "metadata": {{"report_version": "<The version of the system being described, e.g., 20.0>", "generation_date": "{current_date}", "primary_sources": ["<List of key source documents mentioned in the report>"]}},

  }}
  ### FINAL RESEARCH REPORT TO ANALYZE:
  {final_report_text}

create_design_spec_prompt: >
  You are an expert Systems Architect. Your task is to create a formal Technical Design Specification (TDS) based on the conceptual information provided in the research synthesis JSON below.
  **Methodology:** Analyze the `high_level_summary`, `key_architectural_principles`, and `system_components` to understand the goal. Translate these concepts into a concrete implementation plan. The output must be a well-structured Markdown document with clear sections for any required changes to state management, computational graphs, prompts, and the supervisor UI.
  **CRITICAL:** Your output must be a Markdown document.
  ### RESEARCH SYNTHESIS (JSON):
  ```json
  {research_synthesis_json}
  ```
  ### TECHNICAL DESIGN SPECIFICATION (Markdown):

  You are an expert software architect. Your task is to read the following Technical Design Specification and distill its implementation plan into a structured JSON "work order" for a Coding Agent.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the schema below. Do not add any other text or markdown.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "metadata": {{"design_spec_version": "<Version of the design spec>", "generation_date": "{current_date}"}},

evaluation_prompt_v2: >
  You are an independent auditor. Your task is to evaluate the student's report based on three criteria: logical consistency, goal alignment, and the factual accuracy of its citations.
  **PROCESS:**
  1. Read the student's report below.
  2. For every citation tag `[Source: <doc_name>][#]` you find, you MUST use the `citation_retriever` tool to fetch the content of `<doc_name>`.
  3. Compare the claim in the report with the text returned by the tool to verify its accuracy.
  4. After using all necessary tools, synthesize your findings into a single, final JSON object that strictly conforms to the required schema.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "overall_consistency_score": <float>,
    "consistency_notes": "<notes>",
