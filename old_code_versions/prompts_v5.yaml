# prompts_v5.yaml
# v5.0: Implements TDS v6.0 by adding create_design_synthesis_prompt.
# Re-engineers the high-level research task to focus on the Coding Agent.

# --- High-Level Task Definitions ---
research_generation_task: >
  **Primary Goal:** Produce a formal technical research report that proposes a viable architecture for the next major system component: a **Coding Agent**.

  **Methodology:**
  1.  **Analyze Existing System:** Synthesize the current, stable V4 architecture. Acknowledge that the system now produces both a `research_synthesis.json` and a `design_synthesis.json`, establishing a complete, structured data pipeline from research to design.
  2.  **Research SOTA Coding Agents:** Based on the provided knowledge base (e.g., `Overview of AI Code Generation Agents v1.docx`), research the common patterns, components, and required tools for autonomous software engineering agents.
  3.  **Propose an Architecture:** Propose a high-level architecture for our Coding Agent. This proposal should detail:
      - How it will consume the `design_synthesis.json` as its primary work order.
      - The essential tools it will require (e.g., `read_file`, `write_file`, `execute_shell_command`).
      - A conceptual `Plan -> Execute -> Test` loop for its internal operation.

  **Crucial Constraint:**
  - The final report should serve as the foundational research for building the Coding Agent in the next development cycle.

create_plan_prompt: >
  Analyze the user's high-level request and the provided context. Your task is to create a structured **table of contents** for the requested artifact, formatted as a JSON object.
  **Instruction:** The plan you create should be a skeleton or outline for the **final document itself**, NOT a list of your internal process steps.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the schema below. Do not include any other text, comments, or markdown formatting.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "title": "<A concise title for the proposed artifact>",
    "plan_items": [
      {{"section_id": "<e.g., 1.0>", "title": "<Title of the first section>", "description": "<A one-sentence description of what this section will cover.>"}}
    ]
  }}
  ### CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:
  {context}
  ### USER REQUEST:
  {user_prompt}

# --- Prompts for the Synthesis Graph (Student) ---
synthesis_step_prompt: >
  Your task is to generate the content for ONLY the following single item from the overall plan. Use the full plan, user request, and the provided context to ensure your output is relevant and grounded.
  **CRITICAL:** For every substantial claim or piece of data you synthesize from the context, you MUST include an in-line citation tag in the format `[Source: <document_name>]`.
  ### CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:
  {context}
  ### FULL PLAN:
  {plan_str}
  ### CURRENT PLAN ITEM TO EXECUTE:
  {item_title} - {item_description}
  ### GENERATED CONTENT (Markdown with citations):

create_a2a_synthesis_prompt: >
  You are a metadata and systems analysis expert. Your task is to read the following final research report and distill its core conceptual and architectural information into a structured JSON object.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the schema below. Do not add any other text or markdown.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "metadata": {{"report_version": "<The version of the system being described, e.g., 20.0>", "generation_date": "{current_date}", "primary_sources": ["<List of key source documents mentioned in the report>"]}},

  }}
  ### FINAL RESEARCH REPORT TO ANALYZE:
  {final_report_text}

# --- Prompts for the Design Agent ---
create_design_spec_prompt: >
  You are an expert Systems Architect. Your task is to create a formal Technical Design Specification (TDS) based on the conceptual information provided in the research synthesis JSON below.
  **Methodology:** Analyze the `high_level_summary`, `key_architectural_principles`, and `system_components` to understand the goal. Translate these concepts into a concrete implementation plan. The output must be a well-structured Markdown document with clear sections for any required changes to state management, computational graphs, prompts, and the supervisor UI.
  **CRITICAL:** Your output must be a Markdown document.
  ### RESEARCH SYNTHESIS (JSON):
  ```json
  {research_synthesis_json}
  ```
  ### TECHNICAL DESIGN SPECIFICATION (Markdown):

create_design_synthesis_prompt: >
  You are an expert software architect. Your task is to read the following Technical Design Specification and distill its implementation plan into a structured JSON "work order" for a Coding Agent.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the schema below. Do not add any other text or markdown.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "metadata": {{"design_spec_version": "<Version of the design spec>", "generation_date": "{current_date}"}},

# --- Prompts for the Evaluation Graph (Teacher) ---
evaluation_prompt_v2: >
  You are an independent auditor. Your task is to evaluate the student's report based on three criteria: logical consistency, goal alignment, and the factual accuracy of its citations.
  **PROCESS:**
  1. Read the student's report below.
  2. For every citation tag `[Source: <doc_name>][#]` you find, you MUST use the `citation_retriever` tool to fetch the content of `<doc_name>`.
  3. Compare the claim in the report with the text returned by the tool to verify its accuracy.
  4. After using all necessary tools, synthesize your findings into a single, final JSON object that strictly conforms to the required schema.
  **CRITICAL:** Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.
  JSON Schema:
  {{
    "overall_consistency_score": <A float from 0.0 to 1.0 rating the logical flow>,
    "consistency_notes": "<Your detailed notes on the report's coherence and structure>",
    "goal_alignment_check": "<'PASS' or 'FAIL'>",
    "goal_alignment_notes": "<Notes on whether the report fulfills the original user request>",
    "citation_audit": [
      {{
        "claim": "<The sentence or claim made in the report>",
        "citation_tag": "<The exact [Source: ...][#] tag from the report>",
