## **1\. Overview & Core Mission**

This document outlines the architecture for a second-generation **Personalized Agentic Coder**. The agent's mission is to function as an autonomous system capable of writing, testing, and debugging Python code based on a user's knowledge corpus.

This version moves beyond simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by implementing a **cyclical, stateful graph** using the **LangGraph** framework. This architecture enables the agent to perform multi-step reasoning and engage in an iterative **generate-test-reflect-regenerate** loop, which is critical for producing complete and functional code. This iterative process allows the agent to learn from its mistakes and progressively improve its output until a valid solution is achieved.

The primary goal remains recursive self-understanding: the agent should be capable of ingesting its own design documents and source code to reason about, explain, and ultimately regenerate itself.

## **2\. System Goals & Capabilities**

* **Unified Knowledge Ingestion:** Load and process user documents (.md, .docx, .py, etc.) to build a contextual knowledge base.  
* **Agentic Code Generation:**  
  * **Plan:** Deconstruct a coding request into a logical plan.  
  * **Retrieve:** Gather relevant context from the vectorized knowledge base, including existing code examples and design principles.  
  * **Generate:** Write an initial version of the Python script.  
  * **Test:** Execute the generated code in a sandboxed environment to check for syntax errors, runtime exceptions, and other bugs.  
  * **Reflect & Refine:** If the test fails, analyze the error message, reflect on the flawed code, and generate a revised version. This loop continues until the code passes the test or a maximum number of retries is reached.  
* **Transparent Process:** The Streamlit UI will visualize the agent's state and the steps it is taking (e.g., "Generating Code," "Testing Code," "Encountered Error, Refining..."), providing insight into its reasoning process.

## **3\. System Architecture with LangGraph**

The agent's architecture is now centered around a LangGraph state machine.

* **UI Layer (Streamlit):** Captures user prompts and file uploads. It is now responsible for invoking the LangGraph agent and rendering its step-by-step progress and final output.  
* **Agentic Core (LangGraph):**  
  * **Graph State:** A central dictionary that tracks the entire process: prompt, documents, code, error, num\_revisions.  
  * **Nodes:** Each node is a Python function that modifies the state:  
    1. **retrieve\_context:** Populates the documents key in the state by searching the vector store.  
    2. **generate\_code:** Takes the prompt and documents from the state, generates Python code, and updates the code key. It also increments the num\_revisions counter.  
    3. **test\_code:** Executes the code from the code key. If it succeeds, it sets the error key to "False". If it fails, it updates the error key with the specific traceback/error message.  
  * **Conditional Edges:** The logic that controls the agent's iterative loop:  
    * The graph always starts at retrieve\_context and then moves to generate\_code.  
    * After generate\_code, it always proceeds to test\_code.  
    * After test\_code, a conditional edge checks the error key and the num\_revisions counter:  
      * If error is "False", the process is successful, and the graph transitions to the **END** state.  
      * If error is a real message AND num\_revisions is less than a max limit (e.g., 3), the graph loops back to the generate\_code node, enabling the agent to try again.  
      * If the max number of revisions is reached, the graph transitions to the **END** state to prevent infinite loops, reporting its failure.

## **4\. Workflow & Logic**

1. **Initialization:** The Streamlit app launches, the user uploads documents, and a vector store is created and stored in the session state.  
2. **Invocation:** The user submits a coding prompt. The Streamlit app compiles the LangGraph and invokes it with the initial state (the user's prompt).  
3. **Execution Loop:**  
   * **Step 1 (Retrieve):** The retrieve\_context node runs, finding relevant documents. The UI updates to "Retrieving context...".  
   * **Step 2 (Generate):** The generate\_code node runs. The UI updates to "Generating initial code...".  
   * **Step 3 (Test):** The test\_code node runs. The UI updates to "Testing code...".  
   * **Step 4 (Decide):** The conditional edge evaluates the test result.  
     * **On Success:** The UI displays the final, working code. The process ends.  
     * **On Failure:** The UI updates to "Code failed. Analyzing error and refining...". The graph transitions back to Step 2\.  
4. **Termination:** The loop terminates on either success or after reaching the maximum number of retries, with the final state (either the working code or the last failed attempt) being displayed.
