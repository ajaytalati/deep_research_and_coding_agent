# **Technical Research Report: A Multi-Path Agentic System for Code and Report Generation**

Version: 4.0

Date: 2024-06-11

## **1\. Abstract**

This document presents the formal architecture for a multi-path, stateful agent capable of dual-mode operation: acting as a technical researcher to generate formal reports, or as a software engineer to generate, test, and refine working code. The system's core innovation is a routing mechanism that enables it to dynamically select a computational path based on user intent. This architecture is modeled as a state-directed graph, making it directly translatable to frameworks like LangGraph. The ultimate objective is to create a system that can reason about its own specification (this document) and implementation (its source code) to achieve recursive self-generation in either mode.

## **2\. Conceptual and Algorithmic Formulation**

The agent's operation can be modeled as a state transition system. Let the agent's state at any time t be represented by a tuple S\_t.

### **2.1. State Definition**

The state S is a composite data structure defined as:

S \= (P, D, M, T\_m, C, E, R\_n)

Where:

* P: The initial user prompt (a string).  
* D: The set of retrieved context documents. Initially D \= ∅.  
* M: The selected task mode, M ∈ {RESEARCH, CODE, UNDEFINED}. Initially M \= UNDEFINED.  
* T\_m: The main task output (text for report, code for script). Initially T\_m \= "".  
* E: The last captured error message from a tool (e.g., code execution). Initially E \= None.  
* R\_n: The current number of revision attempts. Initially R\_n \= 0.

### **2.2. Node Operations as State Transformations**

Each node in the computational graph is a function f that transforms an input state S\_i into an output state S\_o:

f(S\_i) → S\_o

The primary nodes are defined as:

* f\_retrieve(S): Retrieves documents D' relevant to prompt P.  
  * Returns S' \= (P, D', M, T\_m, E, R\_n).  
* f\_route(S): Analyzes prompt P and documents D to determine the task mode.  
  * Sets M' to either RESEARCH or CODE.  
  * Returns S' \= (P, D, M', T\_m, E, R\_n).  
* f\_generate\_report(S): Synthesizes a research report T\_m' based on P and D.  
  * Returns S' \= (P, D, M, T\_m', E, R\_n).  
* f\_generate\_code(S): Generates code T\_m' based on P, D, and error E.  
  * Increments R\_n to R\_n \+ 1.  
  * Returns S' \= (P, D, M, T\_m', E, R\_n \+ 1\).  
* f\_test\_code(S): Executes code T\_m and captures any error E'.  
  * Returns S' \= (P, D, M, T\_m, E', R\_n).

### **2.3. Graph Edges as a Transition Function**

The flow of the agent is governed by a transition function T(S) which, based on the current state, determines the next node f to execute.

T(S) → f\_next

The transition logic is defined as follows:

1. Entry Point: f\_retrieve  
2. T(S\_retrieve) → f\_route  
3. T(S\_route):  
   * If M \== RESEARCH: → f\_generate\_report  
   * If M \== CODE: → f\_generate\_code  
4. T(S\_generate\_report) → END  
5. T(S\_generate\_code) → f\_test\_code  
6. T(S\_test\_code):  
   * If E \== None: → END  
   * If E \!= None AND R\_n \< R\_max: → f\_generate\_code (The loop for refinement)  
   * If E \!= None AND R\_n \>= R\_max: → END (Failure condition)

This formal structure creates a predictable yet flexible agent that can tackle complex, multi-faceted tasks by breaking them down and following a logical, state-driven path.

## **3\. Implementation Blueprint (for LangGraph)**

This conceptual model maps directly to a LangGraph implementation:

* GraphState is the TypedDict corresponding to S.  
* Each function f\_ is a graph node.  
* The transition function T is implemented using graph.add\_conditional\_edges(), with the routing and error-checking logic determining the path.

## **4\. Recursive Self-Generation Protocol**

To achieve the goal of self-generation, the agent requires specific prompting strategies:

* To Generate This Report:  
  * Prompt: "Acting as a research assistant, analyze your full knowledge base. Produce a formal, technical research report that describes your own architecture using conceptual and algorithmic notation, as defined in document 'Technical Report v4'."  
  * Expected Behavior: The router should select M \= RESEARCH. The f\_retrieve node should be prompted to retrieve the full text of its own design documents. f\_generate\_report will then synthesize a new version of this report.  
* To Generate Its Own Code:  
  * Prompt: "Acting as an expert Python programmer, analyze your full knowledge base, especially the technical research report. Generate a complete, working Python script that implements the multi-path agent described. This script must be self-contained and include its own user interface."  
  * Expected Behavior: The router should select M \= CODE. f\_retrieve should fetch the full technical specification. The f\_generate\_code \-\> f\_test\_code loop will then proceed to write, test, and refine the agent's Python implementation.

This updated architecture provides the necessary sophistication to differentiate between tasks, manage context appropriately, and pursue the complex goal of recursive self-generation.
