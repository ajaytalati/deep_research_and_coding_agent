# **Technical Research Report: A Reflective Multi-Path Agentic System**

Version: 5.0

Date: 2024-06-11

## **1\. Abstract**

This document presents the formal architecture for a reflective, multi-path, stateful agent. This version enhances the previous multi-path design by introducing a self-critique loop within its research generation workflow, analogous to the test-and-refine loop in its coding workflow. The system can dynamically select a "researcher" or "coder" path based on user intent. The researcher path now follows a generate \-\> reflect \-\> refine cycle, enabling the agent to critically evaluate its own generated reports for logical consistency, clarity, and completeness. Furthermore, the agent is explicitly empowered to introduce novel conceptual connections or suggestions, demarcated as footnotes, thereby transcending the limitations of simple retrieval-augmentation to become a creative intellectual partner.

## **2\. Conceptual and Algorithmic Formulation**

The agent's operation is modeled as a state transition system.

### **2.1. State Definition**

The state S is a composite data structure defined as:

S \= (P, D, M, T\_m, K, E, R\_n)

Where:

* P: The initial user prompt (string).  
* D: The set of retrieved context documents. D \= ∅ initially.  
* M: The selected task mode, M ∈ {RESEARCH, CODE, UNDEFINED}. M \= UNDEFINED initially.  
* T\_m: The main task output (text for report, code for script). T\_m \= "" initially.  
* K: A set of critiques or suggestions generated during the reflection step. K \= ∅ initially.  
* E: The last captured error message (from code execution). E \= None initially.  
* R\_n: The current number of revision attempts. R\_n \= 0 initially.

### **2.2. Node Operations as State Transformations**

Each node f is a function that transforms an input state S\_i into an output state S\_o, denoted f(S\_i) → S\_o. *Note: For clarity, S\_f will denote the state after node f has run. For example, S\_retrieve is the state after f\_retrieve completes.*

* f\_retrieve(S): Retrieves documents D' relevant to prompt P.  
  * Returns S\_retrieve where D is now populated with D'.  
* f\_route(S): Analyzes prompt P to determine the task mode M'.  
  * Returns S\_route where M is set to M' ∈ {RESEARCH, CODE}.  
* f\_generate\_report(S): Synthesizes a research report T\_m'. If the input state S contains critiques K, this function refines the previous T\_m based on K.  
  * Increments R\_n.  
  * Returns S\_generate\_report with the new/refined report T\_m' and updated R\_n.  
* f\_reflect\_on\_report(S): Critically evaluates the generated report T\_m against source documents D. It populates K' with identified inconsistencies, ambiguities, or suggestions for improvement.  
  * Returns S\_reflect where K is now populated with K'.  
* f\_generate\_code(S): Generates code T\_m'. If the input state S contains an error E, this function refines the previous T\_m based on E.  
  * Increments R\_n.  
  * Returns S\_generate\_code with the new/refined code T\_m' and updated R\_n.  
* f\_test\_code(S): Executes code T\_m and captures any resulting error E'.  
* Returns S\_test where E is updated with E'.

### **2.3. Graph Edges as a Transition Function**

The transition function T(S) determines the next node based on the current state.

1. Entry Point: f\_retrieve  
2. T(S\_retrieve) → f\_route  
3. T(S\_route):  
   * If M \== RESEARCH → f\_generate\_report (first draft)  
   * If M \== CODE → f\_generate\_code (first draft)  
4. Research Path:  
   * T(S\_generate\_report) → f\_reflect\_on\_report  
   * T(S\_reflect):  
     * If K is empty (report is consistent) OR R\_n \>= R\_max → END  
     * If K is not empty AND R\_n \< R\_max → f\_generate\_report (refinement loop)  
5. Code Path:  
   * T(S\_generate\_code) → f\_test\_code  
   * T(S\_test\_code):  
     * If E \== None → END  
     * If E \!= None AND R\_n \< R\_max → f\_generate\_code (refinement loop)  
     * If E \!= None AND R\_n \>= R\_max → END

### **2.4. Creative Contribution Protocol**

The f\_reflect\_on\_report node is explicitly instructed to go beyond mere verification. Its prompt allows it to suggest novel ideas or connections not present in the source documents D.

* Prompting Strategy: "Are there any external concepts or frameworks that could enhance this analysis? For example, could this formulation be viewed as a Markov Decision Process? If you have such creative suggestions, clearly label them under a 'Further Considerations' section or in footnotes."  
* Output: The agent's final report will thus contain two classes of information: 1\) High-fidelity synthesis grounded in the knowledge base, and 2\) Clearly demarcated creative contributions from the LLM's own knowledge.

This updated architecture creates a more robust, reliable, and genuinely collaborative agent.
