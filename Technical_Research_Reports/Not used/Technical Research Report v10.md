# **Technical Research Report: A Sequential, Tri-Modal Constitutional Agent System**

Version: 10.0

Date: 2025-06-12

## **1\. Abstract**

This document presents the architecture for a sequential, tri-modal, constitutional multi-agent system. This final version addresses the critical challenge of context pollution by evolving the orchestrating Supervisor from a simple task initiator to a Sequential, State-Passing Manager. The system explicitly models the ideal development workflow: 1\) Research Report Generation, 2\) Code Implementation, and 3\. Technical Documentation. The supervisor ensures the output of each stage (e.g., the generated code) becomes the explicit, high-priority context for the subsequent stage (e.g., documentation generation), guaranteeing contextual continuity and accuracy. This architecture, governed by the established Shared Constitution, culminates in a robust framework capable of not only generating high-quality, discrete artifacts but also of performing a final, user-initiated Meta-Reflection to ensure the holistic consistency of all its outputs, fulfilling the project's core goal of reproducible self-generation.

## **2\. The Final Architectural Enhancement: Sequential State-Passing**

Previous versions revealed a subtle but critical flaw: when generating an artifact that depended on a previously generated one (e.g., documenting code), the agent's retrieval mechanism could become "polluted" by other, older files in the knowledge base. The v10 architecture solves this by making the Supervisor responsible for managing the state across the entire sequence of tasks.

* State-Passing Mechanism: The supervisor is no longer a stateless task runner. After an artifact is generated and finalized (e.g., agent\_core\_final.py and supervisor\_final.py), the supervisor stores this output. When the user initiates the next task in the sequence (e.g., documentation), the supervisor directly injects the content of the finalized code into the prompt for the documentation agents. This ensures they work from the "ground truth" of the most recent, relevant context, rather than relying on a potentially noisy retrieval search.

## **3\. The Complete R\&D Workflow**

The system now formally supports a three-stage workflow, orchestrated by the state-passing supervisor.

1. Stage 1: Research Report Generation. The user initiates the process with a prompt to generate the high-level conceptual report. The constitutional agents collaborate to produce report\_final.md.  
2. Stage 2: Code Generation. The user initiates the coding task. The supervisor's prompt to the coding agents will now explicitly reference report\_final.md as the primary specification. The agents collaborate to produce agent\_core\_final.py and supervisor\_final.py.  
3. Stage 3: Technical Documentation Generation. The user initiates the documentation task. The supervisor's prompt to the documentation agents will explicitly include the full text of both report\_final.md and the two \_final.py scripts. This guarantees the documentation is perfectly aligned with the artifacts it is meant to describe.  
4. Stage 4 (Optional): Meta-Reflection. As a final validation step, the user can issue a "meta-reflection" prompt, asking the agent to review the holistic consistency of all three generated artifacts.

## **4\. Final Testing and Self-Generation Protocol**

The ultimate test of the system is its ability to "close the loop" and reproduce itself. This is now achieved via the following user-driven protocol:

1. Bootstrap: The user runs the master agent (supervisor\_v10.py).  
2. Generate Report: The user issues the prompt to generate the research report. The agent produces report\_final.md.  
3. Generate Code: The user issues the prompt to generate the code, referencing the new report. The agent produces agent\_core\_final.py and supervisor\_final.py.  
4. Generate Docs: The user issues the prompt to generate documentation for the new report and code. The agent produces docs\_final.md.  
5. The "Final Exam": The user starts a new session with the *generated* supervisor\_final.py. They load *only* the three generated artifacts (report\_final.md, agent\_core\_final.py, docs\_final.md) into the knowledge base and re-run the three generation prompts. The system passes the test if the newly generated artifacts are functionally and logically equivalent to the ones used as input.

This sequential, state-passing architecture represents a mature and robust solution for complex, multi-stage artifact generation, finally achieving the project's goal of creating a truly self-documenting and self-reproducing agentic system.
