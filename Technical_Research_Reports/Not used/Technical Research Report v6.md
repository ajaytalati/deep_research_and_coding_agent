# **Technical Research Report: An Observable, Reflective Multi-Path Agentic System**

Version: 6.0

Date: 2025-06-11

## **1\. Abstract**

This document presents the formal architecture for an observable, reflective, multi-path agent. This version enhances previous designs by integrating a chain-of-thought logging mechanism to improve transparency, debuggability, and the robustness of the agent's internal decision-making processes. The agent's core architecture allows it to dynamically select a "researcher" or "coder" path. Crucially, the routing and reasoning nodes now output not only their decisions but also the explicit reasoning behind them. This "chain of thought" is captured in the agent's state and exposed to the user, providing critical insight into the agent's behavior and a powerful tool for diagnosing and correcting failures, such as task misclassification.

## **2\. Conceptual and Algorithmic Formulation**

The agent's operation is modeled as a state transition system.

### **2.1. State Definition**

The state S is now expanded to include an explicit log:

S \= (P, D, M, T\_m, K, E, R\_n, L)

Where:

* P: The initial user prompt.  
* D: The set of retrieved context documents.  
* M: The selected task mode, M âˆˆ {RESEARCH, CODE, UNDEFINED}.  
* T\_m: The main task output (report or code).  
* K: Critiques from the reflection step.  
* E: Error messages from code execution.  
* R\_n: The number of revision attempts.  
* L: An ordered list of strings representing the agent's chain-of-thought log. L \= \[\] initially.

### **2.2. Node Operations with Observability**

Node definitions are updated to contribute to the log L. Each node f now performs its primary function and appends a description of its action and reasoning to the log.

* f\_route(S): This is the most significantly updated node. It is now prompted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning *before* making a classification.  
  * Internal Logic: The LLM prompt is now: "First, provide a step-by-step reasoning for your decision based on the user's prompt. Then, on a new line, classify the task as either 'research' or 'code'."  
  * State Transformation: The node parses the LLM's output, separating the reasoning from the final classification.  
  * Returns S\_route where:  
    * L is appended with the LLM's reasoning text.  
    * M is set to the final classification.  
* Other Nodes (f\_retrieve, f\_generate\_report, etc.): Each node now appends a simple, descriptive string to the log L upon execution (e.g., "Retrieving top 10 documents.", "Entering code generation loop, revision 2.").

### **2.3. Graph Edges and User Interface**

The graph's structure and transition logic remain the same as in v5. The primary change is in the user interface, which is now designed to render the log L as it is populated. This provides a real-time, step-by-step view of the agent's internal state and decision-making process, allowing the user to immediately see, for example, *why* the f\_route node chose a particular path.

This principle of making reasoning an explicit output is a critical technique for debugging and aligning complex agentic systems. By forcing the agent to "show its work," we can more easily identify and correct flaws in its logic or prompting, leading to a more robust and reliable system.
