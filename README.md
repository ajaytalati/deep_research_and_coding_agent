TODO

- Add the a second LLM to the desgin, coding and PM agents - so that they are also student-teacher as the research agent is
- Consolidate all the features in TRR (tech research reports) and TDS (tech design specs) since first drafts, as Gemini has lost many of the features
- Add the code checking (i.e. make sure it alteach runs without errots) to the coding agent
- The project manager agent should maintain a list of features (so that if Gemini misses them they are not lost)
- Move the whole project onto Github, ASAP, so that Github co-pilot can be used
- Add folders to store all TRR and TDS
